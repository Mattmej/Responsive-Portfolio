                        Hi. I'm Matt Mejia, and I combine a methodical approach to problems with a compassionate approach to people. I have a Bachelor
                        of Arts in physics, which I have put to use by helping students through substitute teaching and tutoring.
                        I serve as a substitute teacher at Flintridge Preparatory School in La Canada, and I tutor students
                        in the San Gabriel Valley area.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As a substitute teacher I specialize in math and physics. My greatest achievement is teaching an AP Calculus class for a
                        month while the class' instructor attended an important math conference. Keeping track of the instructor's
                        notes, teaching the lesson effectively, and adapting to the students' questions were challenging,
                        but these challenges were rewarding for me when the students smiled and told me "thank you."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I tutor students in math, physics, and test preparation. The best part of personal tutoring is seeing my students' faces
                        light up with comprehension and their parents' faces light up with pride. Students vouch for my ability
                        to make hard subjects easier, and several thankful parents tell me that I have helped raise their
                        children's SAT scores by as much as 100 points. I hope that by helping my students with difficult
                        topics I can help them with fostering a growth mindset and building self-confidence.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I look forward to helping you with your needs, whether they be related to programming or teaching. Thank you for visiting
                        my page!
                    </p>
